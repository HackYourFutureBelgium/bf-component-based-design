# Testing React Components with Vitest

## Step 1: Setup a React Project using Vite

First, you need to create a new React project using Vite. Follow the steps below:

1. **Create a new Vite project**:

    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest
    ```

    - You will be prompted to provide a project name (e.g., `react-vitest`).
    - Select the framework as `React` and the variant as `TypeScript`.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd react-vitest
    ```

3. **Install project dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  
    You should see the development server running, indicating that the basic project setup is complete.

## Step 2: Add Dependencies for Testing

Next, you need to add the necessary dependencies for testing with Vitest and Testing Library.

1. **Install the testing dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install -D vitest jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
    ```

## Step 3: Configure Vitest for Testing

To configure Vitest for your project, follow these steps:

1. **Update `vite.config.ts`**:
    Open `vite.config.ts` and replace its content with the following code:

    ```typescript
    /// <reference types="vitest" />
    /// <reference types="vite/client" />

    import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
    import { defineConfig } from "vite";

    export default defineConfig({
        plugins: [react()],
        test: {
            globals: true,
            environment: "jsdom",
            setupFiles: ["src/setupTest.ts"],
        },
    });
    ```

2. **Update `package.json` scripts**:
    Extend the `scripts` section in `package.json` with the following code:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "test": "vitest",
        "coverage": "vitest run --coverage"
    }
    ```

3. **Create a setup file for Testing Library**:
    Create a new file named `src/setupTest.ts` and add the following content:

    ```typescript
    // jest-dom adds custom jest matchers for asserting on DOM nodes.
    // allows you to do things like:
    // expect(element).toHaveTextContent(/react/i)
    // learn more: https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom
    import "@testing-library/jest-dom";
    ```

4. **Include the setup file in `tsconfig.json`**:
    Open `tsconfig.json` and include the path to the setup file by adding it to the `include` array:

    ```json
    "include": ["src", "./setupTest.ts"]
    ```

## Step 4: Write Tests for Your Components

Now that the setup is complete, let's write some tests for the `App` component.

1. **Create a test file**:
    Create a new file named `src/App.test.tsx` and add the following test code:

    ```typescript
    import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
    import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
    import App from "./App";

    describe("Renders main page correctly", () => {
        it("Should render the page correctly", () => {
            // Setup
            render(<App />);
            const h1 = screen.queryByText("Vite + React");

            // Expectations
            expect(h1).toBeInTheDocument();
        });
    });
    ```

## Step 5: Run Your Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

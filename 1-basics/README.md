# Basics

## Objectives

1. Understand what is ReactJS: [see doc](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
2. Use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to start a project: [see doc](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
3. Understand JSX: [see doc](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
4. Render your first component: [see doc](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)
5. Split your app into different component and pass props: [see doc](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
6. Render elements from lists: [see doc](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

## Code example

You can find in this folder the most minimal example for a React App to start it:

1. Open your terminal in the `1-basics` folder
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Launch the local dev server by running `npm run dev`
4. Access you app in your favorite browser at `https://localhost:5173`

## Exercise

The goal will be at the end of the 3 weeks to build a Pokemon app. In the meantime, with what you've learned in this first class, you can already achieve the first part the this app. This exercise will be the base for next week so we will work from it to learn more about React based on it.

1. Create a basic layout to display the app - Feel free to be creative and find nice design inspiration on internet
2. Separate your app into different components
3. Try to prepare some UI element you can reuse (Pokemon card, Button, input,...)
4. BONUS - Plan the responsiveness

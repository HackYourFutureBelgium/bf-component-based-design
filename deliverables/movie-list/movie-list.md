## Setup

- Copy and paste the provided data inside the src folder of your new project

## Phases

This project uses concepts from the first few chapters in this module, breaking the project into 3 phases will help you master each concept before moving on:

1. **Render the Movies**: Render the complete list of movies with no user interactions. Just a pretty page full of movie thumbnails.
2. **Filter the Movies**: Add a text input field so users can filter the movies in realtime.
3. **Movie Details**: A user can click on any movie thumbnail to learn more about that film. (they can also go back to the main page!)

## Checklists

This is a project for individual work, here's a checklist for your `deliverable` issue:

- [ ] [many small, well-named commits per component](https://github.com/_/_/commits)
- [ ] a nice README
- [pull requests](https://github.com/_/_/pulls)
  - [ ] code review checklist is complete (write your own check list!)
```
